# Books key points

## Part I, Data Structures

- Special methods (e.g: `__repr`)
- Use of collection types: sequences, mappings, sets, string versus bytes split
- High-level class builders in standard library: named tuple factories and `@dataclass` decorator
- Pattern matching (3.10 feature)
- Objects lifecycle: references, mutability and garbage collection

## Part II, Functions as Objects

- Functions as first-class objects in the language
  - Meaning of its existance
  - Affection on design patterns
  - Implement function decorators by leveraging closures
- General concept of callables in Python, function attributes, introspection, parameter annotations, nonlocal declaration (new)
- Type hints in function signatures

## Part III, Classes and Protocols

- Focus on building classes "by hand"
- Build customized collections
- OOP stuffs
  - Abstract base classes (ABCs) and protocols
  - Multiple inheritance
- Implement operator overloading

## Part IV, Control Flow

- Constructs and libraries go beyond traditional control flow with conditions, loops and subroutines
  - Generators
  - Context managers
  - Coroutines
- Powerful `yield from` syntax
- Concurrent and parallel processing in Python

## Part V, Metaprogramming

- Classes with attributes created dynamically to handle semi-structured data (e.g: JSON)
- Properties mechanism, descriptors
- Relationship among functions, methods and descriptors
- Class decorators and metaclasses
